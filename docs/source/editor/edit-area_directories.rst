Directories
-----------

There are two levels of directories: The level of a collection, which is
the highest level and holds specific settings and configurations of your
entire collection e.g. a logo that is displayed on every level
underneath. The next level are all directories in your collection and
their subfolders, basically they define the browsing structure. General
functions are the same on both levels; the main difference is the
status. Therefore the directories function is described first and later
the collection level with its central settings is described. **Available
operations regarding folders:**

-  See folder and all objects which are contained in the selected folder
-  Edit folder and all objects which are contained in the selected
   folder
-  Download original files (TIFF/JPG/PNG/BMP of original size, PDF
   files, videos, etc.) which are contained in the selected folder (or
   its subfolders).

In general folder related (or object related) authorizations are
assigned to user groups and every individual account is assigned to one
or more user groups. So you can perform all operations for which your
"parent" user groups are authorized. **Examples:**

-  You can always see and edit your own user directory and all
   subdirectories or objects therein: e.g. User directory (*YourName*).
-  If you administer a collection, you can see and edit the collection
   directory and its content (e.g Image Archive Wood Construction).

1. Selecting folders for displaying folder content and editing purposes

Select folder in the *Folder administration* area. If needed display
subfolders by selecting |image0| or hide subfolders by selecting
|image1| **Result:**

-  In the *Folder administration* screen area the selected (*active*)
   directory is tagged with a triangle **(1)**.
-  In the *Data editing* screen area all directory related (operation-)
   tabs are being displayed in the upper part of the *Data editing*
   area.
-  The selected (*active*) directory is being displayed with the label
   *Selected/Editing* **(2)**.
-  All objects (images, documents) which are contained in the selected
   folder are being displayed in a short format in the lower part of the
   screen **(3)**.

**Remark:** Content of subfolders will not be displayed.

2. Directory editing by means of the *General administrative functions*
panel

There are two categories of editing operations which can be initiated by
means of the *General administrative functions* panel. 

.. figure:: images/directory-menu.jpg
   :width: 278 px

   Directory menu

Editing of **directory structure**

-  create directory
-  move a directory to another position in the tree
-  sort subfolders
-  delete a directory

Editing of **directory name**

-  edit (directory)

Special editing function:

-  clear trashbox (all deleted objects are automatically moved to the
   *Trashbox* in the work directory)

2.1 Create new folder

A new directory/folder will always be created as a subfolder of a
previously selected initial directory. When the new folder is created
you can edit the name and select a display format for the result list in
the standard web interface. First select the directory in which you want
to insert a new subfolder. Select the option *Create: Directory* A new
directory has been created. The new directory is a subfolder of the
initial directory. In order to edit the name of the new directory you
have to select the *Edit* option. There are also fields to set the
display format of objects for this new directory to a default setting.
You could choose between options for the default short display (*short
view style*) and the default full display (*full view style*).

2.2 Delete folder

Select the directory by mouse click. Select *Directory* and then
*Delete* in the *General administrative functions* panel. **Remark:** If
you delete a directory the contained subfolders will be also deleted. If
image objects or document files are contained only in the folder, which
is to be deleted, they will be moved to the *Trashbox*. But if image
objects, documents, etc are contained also in other folders, they still
will be found in those other folders. As well there is a directory
called *Trashbox*. This directory holds all deleted objects so that they
can be restored in case of deleting an object by accident. You could
also delete the folders *Uploads* and *Inconsistent data*. The software
will automatically create those two folders anew, if they are needed for
administration purposes.

2.3 Move directory

When you move a directory to another position in the tree by means of
the *Move to...* operation in the directory menu, the moving folder will
be inserted as a subfolder in the target folder. If you would like to
change the sequence of folders (that means "moving" a folder within a
given hierarchical level), then you have to use the *Sort subfolders*
operation. **How to do it:**

#. Select the directory you want to move by mouse click.
#. Select the *Move toâ€¦* option in the directory menu.
#. Select the target directory into which the moving folder is to be
   inserted.

from the edited folder, but will still be found in those other folders.
**Selecting folder objects and transferring them to the object *Data
editing*** Select objects. Select *Files*, then *Simultaneous editing*
frame (if more than one object has been selected, data editing will be
done for all selected objects at the same time) or *Files*, then *Single

   Sort subfolders


3.3 Edit metadata

Editing the metadata is slightly different weather you are on collection
level or just on normal directory level. In general the functions are
similar and described as follows:

-  Change the name of the selected directory
-  Define the short format for display of result lists in the standard
   Web interface. Available formats: text, list, thumbnails. Definition
   valid only for collection type folders

**Example:** Editing at Collection level Select collection. Select *Edit
metadata* and again *Edit metadata* in the *Data editing* frame.

.. figure:: images/editmetadata11.jpg
   :width: 342 px

    Edit metadata

The following screen will come
up: 

.. figure:: images/editmetadata2.jpg
   :width: 861 px

   Edit metadata

Here you can edit
the general parameters of a collection, e.g. name. You can set the
display format of objects for a collection to a default display setting.
Therefore you have to change from *Standard edit mask* to *Edit mask for
Administrators* first. Then you can choose between three options for the
short display:

-  thumbnail
-  list
-  text

This setting can only be changed at collection level. This means a
setting on directory level will be overwritten by the setting that is
made at collection level. As mentioned above make sure that you change
the setting not in the standard editing mask but the edit mask for
administrators. To edit names of folders the procedure is the same, just
click on the folder and follow the same menu steps as above. There are
also fields to set the display format of objects for this directory to a
default setting. In theory you could edit the setting for the directory
level but this setting will always be overwritten by the setting that
has been made at collection level.

3.4 Permissions

Folder related (or object related) authorizations are assigned to user
groups. Every individual account is assigned to one or more user groups.
Available operations regarding folders and objects in folders:

-  see folder and all objects which are contained in the selected folder
-  edit folder and all objects which are contained in the selected
   folder
-  download original files (TIFF/JPG/PNG/BMP of original size, PDF
   files, videos, etc.) which are contained in the selected folder (or
   its subfolders)

Collections are treated as folders. Generally, permissions are valid for
folders and all objects (e.g. objects, subfolders) therein. **Remark:**
If there is no entry in the "permission frame" (that means if you don't
assign a right to a user group), then the collection content can be seen
and downloaded without restriction by everyone (worldwide)! In order to
manage the rights select directory, select *Rights* and than *Rights
management*. Select user group by clicking on it and assign or disallow
permissions via clicking the button.

3.5 Start page of a collection or directory.

**Functional description:** For every collection or directory an
individual frontpage with text and/or images can be created. This
function can be used to present your collection with explanations and
information on the actual collection. At directory level you can e.g.
give an overview of a subsection. It is not necessary to create a start
page but if no start page is defined, a list of objects that are located
underneath that hirachy level will be displayed. In some cases it might
be handy to not have a list but to give some general information on the
objects or your institutions. In case you create some start page, please
consider, that the files saved in the folder with a startpage won't be
available in the website view. So if you want the users, that have the
right to see the folder and the files in it, but not the right to edit
it, to be able really to see the files, you have to locate this files in
some subfolder of the folder with a startpage. You can set up pages in
different languages for a folder, e.g. english or german pages that are
connected to the specific language chosen by the user. To manage and
create start pages

#. Select collection or directory
#. Select menu *Layout* and *Manage startpages*. The following screen
   will come up. It shows that no startpage is defined yet.
#. To create a start page click on the yellow box symbol on the right.
#. A HTML editing window opens that allows you to enter contents (text,
   images) to the page. Functions are similar to that in MS Word. You
   can enter text, images, tables, etc. Save the entered content by
   clicking on the button below the content box.

Select *Layout* and *Manage startpages* again from the menu. The first
start page has been created and you can edit the following:

#. The page can be named, which is optional but recommended when using
   more than one start page for the same directory/collection. Just
   enter a name in the field *Descriptive name*.
#. To see a preview from the page, click on the blue triangle facing to
   the right.
#. You can set for which language(s) the start page should be used. It
   can either be used for both, english and german or just one of them
   by ticking the box.
#. To edit a start page again, click on the edit symbol and change the
   content. Don't forget to save the changes.
#. Save changes to keep name and language settings.

You can create another start page by clicking on
the yellow box and change language settings as you need. **Manage and
use images in the HTML editing tool** You can use images that are
already saved as objects in mediaTUM. Simply use the link provided in
the normal web view when you open the original image and do a right
mouse click > *Image properties*. Of course you can also use the smaller
thumbnail image of the full view by using the *Image properties* link of
the right mouse click menu. Insert link to the image by clicking on the
image button |image20| of the editor and insert the URL in the *Image
Info* field for an URL. You can also use different images that are not
part of your collection or images that are generally stored in a
restricted area but can still be used for that purpose. You can upload
images specially for the display on the start page.

#. Move cursor on the spot where the image should be inserted and click
   on the image button of the HTML editor's menu.
